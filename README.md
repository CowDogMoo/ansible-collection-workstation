workstation environment, covering various aspects, including user setup,
package management, ZSH configuration, VNC setup, ASDF version manager,
AI development tools (Fabric, Claude Code), and logging for different applications.

## Requirements

- Ansible 2.15 or higher

## Installation

Install latest version of the Workstation collection:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/CowDogMoo/ansible-collection-workstation.git,main
```

Alternatively, you can build the collection locally and install it from
the generated tarball:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection build --force && \
  ansible-galaxy collection install cowdogmoo-workstation-*.tar.gz -p ~/.ansible/collections --force --pre
```

## Roles

### ASDF

Installs and configures [ASDF](https://asdf-vm.com/), a version manager for
multiple language runtimes.

### User Setup

Sets up user accounts with optional sudo privileges on Unix-like systems.

### Package Management

Manages package installations and cleanups on Debian-based and Red Hat-based systems.

### Zsh Setup

Installs and configures Zsh with Oh-My-Zsh, setting up a robust shell environment.

### VNC Setup

Configures VNC services for remote desktop access, including password
management and service setup.

### Logging

Creates logging directories and log rotation configurations for a provided path.

### Fabric

Installs and configures [Fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric),
an open-source AI framework for augmenting humans using AI.

### Claude Code

Installs and manages [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)
CLI, including installation, configuration, hooks, and settings.

### Go Task

Installs and configures [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/), a task runner and
build tool written in Go, providing a simpler alternative to Make.

### Build Cleanup

A general-purpose, parameterized cleanup role for build artifact minimization.
Optimizes container images and build environments by removing unnecessary files,
caches, and temporary artifacts.

## Usage

Include the roles from this collection in your playbook. Here's an example:

```yaml
---
- name: Provision system
  hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - cowdogmoo.workstation.asdf
    - cowdogmoo.workstation.user_setup
    - cowdogmoo.workstation.package_management
    - cowdogmoo.workstation.fabric
    - cowdogmoo.workstation.claude_code
    ...
```

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

To set up the development environment and install all required dependencies,
including docsible for automatic documentation generation:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r .hooks/requirements.txt
```

### Documentation Generation

This project uses [docsible](https://github.com/docsible/docsible) to automatically
generate documentation for Ansible roles. Documentation is generated automatically
via pre-commit hooks when changes are made to role files.
