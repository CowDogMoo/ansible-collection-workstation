### User Setup

Sets up user accounts with optional sudo privileges on Unix-like systems.

### Package Management

Manages package installations and cleanups on Debian-based and Red Hat-based systems.

### Zsh Setup

### VNC Setup

Configures VNC services for remote desktop access, including password
management and service setup.

### Logging

## Usage

Include the roles from this collection in your playbook. Here's an example:

```yaml
---
- name: Provision container
  hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - cowdogmoo.workstation.asdf
    - cowdogmoo.workstation.user_setup
    - cowdogmoo.workstation.package_management
    ...
```

## Development

### Setting Up Development Environment

To set up the development environment and install all required dependencies,
including docsible for automatic documentation generation:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r .hooks/requirements.txt
```

### Documentation Generation

This project uses [docsible](https://github.com/docsible/docsible) to automatically
generate documentation for Ansible roles. Documentation is generated automatically
via pre-commit hooks when changes are made to role files.
